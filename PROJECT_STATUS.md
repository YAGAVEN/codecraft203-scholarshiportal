- Removed scraped website data (`clone/` directory)
- Deleted 8 unnecessary documentation files
- Removed mock data directory (`src/data/`)
- Cleaned up temporary files and artifacts

### 🏗️ Architecture Implementation (25+ files created)

#### **Layered Architecture Structure:**
```
Controllers → Services → Repositories → Models
    ↓           ↓            ↓           ↓
  HTTP      Business      Data       Domain
 Handling    Logic       Access     Entities
```

**Created:**
- ✅ 5 Model files (Domain entities)
- ✅ 5 DTO files (API contracts)
- ✅ 6 Repository files (Data access layer)
- ✅ 5 Service files (Business logic)
- ✅ 4 Refactored controllers (API routes)

### 🔧 Bug Fixes
- ✅ Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Removed mock data dependencies
- ✅ Connected UI to database via Supabase
- ✅ Added proper type annotations
- ✅ Implemented loading states

### 📚 Documentation
- ✅ Updated README.md with architecture overview
