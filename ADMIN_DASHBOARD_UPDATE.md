- Auto-refreshes data after approval/rejection

### Recent Users Section

### Quick Actions
Three action cards for future features:

2. **User Management**: Manage student and provider accounts
3. **Send Notification**: Broadcast messages to all users

## Security
All admin endpoints verify:
1. User is authenticated
2. User has 'admin' role
3. Returns 401 (Unauthorized) if not logged in
4. Returns 403 (Forbidden) if not admin
