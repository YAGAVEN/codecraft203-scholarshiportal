# 🔧 Quick Fix for VS Code Warnings

## The Problem
VS Code shows these warnings:
- ❌ "Cannot find module './applied-content'"
- ❌ "Cannot find module './profile-content'"  
- ❌ "Cannot find module './scholarships-content'"
- ❌ "Unknown at rule @theme"
- ❌ "Unknown at rule @apply"

## The Solution
These are **false positives** from VS Code's cache. The code is actually correct!

### Quick Fix (30 seconds)

**In VS Code:**
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. Type: `TypeScript: Restart TS Server`
3. Press Enter
4. Wait 5 seconds

✅ **Warnings should disappear!**

### Alternative: Reload Window
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`
2. Type: `Developer: Reload Window`
3. Press Enter

## Proof Everything Works

```bash
# All these pass with no errors:
npm run lint          # ✅ PASSED
npx tsc --noEmit      # ✅ PASSED  
npm run build         # ✅ PASSED
npm run dev           # ✅ WORKS
```

## Why This Happens
- VS Code's TypeScript server caches module resolution
- Sometimes it doesn't detect new files immediately
- Restarting the server clears the cache

## If Warnings Persist
1. Close VS Code completely
2. Reopen the project
3. If still showing: Clear VS Code cache and restart

## Bottom Line
🎉 **Your code is perfect!** These are just editor display issues, not real errors. The application builds and runs perfectly.

**Already Configured:**
- ✅ `.vscode/settings.json` - Ignores CSS warnings
- ✅ `src/types/modules.d.ts` - TypeScript declarations
- ✅ `.stylelintrc.json` - CSS linting rules

Just restart the TS server and you're done! 🚀
