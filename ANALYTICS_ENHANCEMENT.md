# Admin Navigation & Analytics Enhancement

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Scholarships Page from Admin Navigation ✅
**File:** `src/components/navbar.tsx`

**Previous Admin Navigation:**
- Dashboard
- Analytics
- Users
- Scholarships ❌ (Removed)
- Profile

**Updated Admin Navigation:**
- Dashboard
- Analytics
- Users
- Profile

**Reason:** Admins don't need a dedicated scholarships browsing page as they can:
- View pending scholarships directly from the dashboard
- Approve/reject scholarships from the dashboard
- Access all scholarship data through analytics

### 2. Enhanced Analytics Page with Visual Charts ✅
**File:** `src/app/admin/analytics/analytics-content.tsx`

#### Added Visual Components:

**a) User Distribution Donut Chart**
- Shows breakdown of Students vs Providers
- Color-coded segments (Blue for Students, Purple for Providers)
- Displays percentages and counts
- CSS-based donut chart (no external libraries needed)

**b) Scholarship Status Bar Chart**
- Visual bars for Active, Pending, and Rejected scholarships
- Height represents percentage of total
- Color-coded: Green (Active), Yellow (Pending), Red (Rejected)
- Shows counts on hover

**c) Application Status Bar Chart**
- Visual bars for Pending, Shortlisted, and Selected applications
- Height represents percentage of total
- Color-coded: Yellow (Pending), Blue (Shortlisted), Green (Selected)
- Shows counts and percentages

**d) Enhanced Performance Metrics**
- Application Success Rate with animated progress bar
- Scholarship Approval Rate with animated progress bar
- Both show percentage and visual representation

#### Layout Structure:
```
Analytics Page
├── User Statistics (3 cards + Donut Chart)
│   ├── Total Users
│   ├── Students
│   ├── Providers
│   └── User Distribution Donut
├── Scholarship Statistics (4 cards + Bar Chart)
│   ├── Total Scholarships
│   ├── Active
│   ├── Pending
│   ├── Rejected
│   └── Scholarship Status Bar Chart
├── Application Statistics (4 cards + Bar Chart)
│   ├── Total Applications
│   ├── Pending
│   ├── Shortlisted
│   ├── Selected
│   └── Application Status Bar Chart
├── Performance Metrics (2 cards with progress bars)
│   ├── Application Success Rate
│   └── Scholarship Approval Rate
└── Platform Insights (summary card)
```

### 3. Fixed TypeScript Errors ✅
**File:** `src/components/navbar.tsx`

**Issue:** 
- Line 37: `any[]` type for notifications array
- Line 68: `any` type in filter function

**Solution:**
Created proper TypeScript interface:
```typescript
interface Notification {
  id: string;
  user_id: string;
  title: string;
  message: string;
  is_read: boolean;
  created_at: string;
}
```

Replaced all `any` types with `Notification` type:
- `useState<Notification[]>([])`
- Filter function: `(n: Notification) => !n.is_read`
